# Linen — Your Personal AI Memory Assistant

**A privacy-first Progressive Web App that combines conversational AI with intelligent memory management.**

> *What if your personal assistant never forgot a detail about your life, understood your emotions, and worked completely offline?*

## 🎯 What is Linen?

Linen is a sophisticated web application designed to be your digital companion. It learns from your conversations, remembers what matters to you, and provides thoughtful responses when you need them most.

Unlike traditional note-taking apps or journaling tools, Linen is **interactive**. It engages in real conversations, understands context, and helps you work through problems while preserving your memories.

**And the best part?** Everything stays on your device. Your memories never leave your computer or phone.

## 💬 Questions?

**How private is it really?**
Everything stored locally on your device. No data sent anywhere unless you add an API key (which you control).

**What if I don't have an API key?**
No problem! The Local Assistant works completely offline. You won't have memory persistence, but you get core functionality.

**Can I use multiple AI providers?**
Yes! Add as many API keys as you want and switch between them anytime.

**Will my data transfer between devices?**
Currently, no. Data is device-specific. (Future enhancement: optional encrypted cloud sync)

**Is the code open source?**
The app is deployed at [https://github.com/ramin-najafi/ramin-najafi.github.io](https://github.com/ramin-najafi/ramin-najafi.github.io). Feel free to fork, learn, and build on it.
